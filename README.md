# WebGame Overview

## Controls
- **Keyboard:** Use `A/D` to move, `Space` once to jump, twice to dash and `Esc` to pause or leave overlays.
- **Controller (optional):** Left stick or D-pad moves the operative; the A Button on an Xbox Controller triggers the jump and dash

## Features
- Fast loop-based engine that drives rendering, audio, entities, particles, and the in-game timer.
- Modular UI overlays for title, win, and lose states that pause/resume gameplay automatically.
- Built-in level editor (see `level-editor.html`) for designing JSON maps, including spawn object placement.
